# Bedtime Bytes 


An App that writes YOUR stories, YOUR way.

## Bedtime Bytes: What is it?

We use generative AI to write, illustrate, and narrate bedtime stories to your kids.

## Why Bedtime Bytes? 

Families miss out on storytime due to a variety of reasons. We'd like to make storytime accessible for everyone, and we'd like to do it while making our audience feel represented.

Our app lets users:
- Customize the story subject and writing style
- Create story-related images according to their favorite art styles
- Choose the narration voice or build a voice model of themselves to send to family and friends
